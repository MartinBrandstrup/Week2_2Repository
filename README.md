# Week2_2Repository
 
For the Tuesday assignment "JavaScript Exercises" I have done up to and including assignment 4
found in 03-03_JavaScriptExercises.html and .js

For the Wednesday assignment "FetchAndPromises" I did everything except the very last part of assignment 4
found in the folder 03-04_FetchAndPromises

For the thursday assignment I did some of it, but it got lost somewhere in the ether when trying to push
to github from my laptop and then pushing from my desktop without pulling first. Not exactly sure what went
wrong, but I hadn't done much anyway, so just consider that part not done.

For the friday assignment I only managed to start on the Exam Preparation SP5_AJAX_CORS, can be found in the folder
03-06_AJAX_CORS

Hopefully this is enough to warrant a couple studypoints if nothing else
